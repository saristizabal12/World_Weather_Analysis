# World_Weather_Analysis
We are creating a world weather analysis using API

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. 

In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then we used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

## Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
We used Google's Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, we created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
